                                        Welcome, dear friends and fellow degens!
                                        Is there a better time than today to be
                                        part of this incredible NFT space? Has
                                        there ever been a better time to be
                                        alive? For me there hasn’t been, what we
                                        are all achieving as a team is beyond my
                                        wildest dreams and I can’t wait for you
                                        to be part of the Fairy Planet community
                                        so we can share the experience. My
                                        co-founder and I are ravenous NFT
                                        collectors and big gamblers. But we are
                                        also entrepreneurs and see a gap in the
                                        market. We want to build an NFT
                                        collection that incorporates our passion
                                        for art and gambling, but also gives
                                        owners unmatched utility. Something we
                                        feel is missing in many of the NFT
                                        projects currently out there. The
                                        Metaverse will be a digital utopia where
                                        all is possible, everywhere, all the
                                        time, in high definition clarity.
                                        Infinite, vibrant, alive and buzzing
                                        with art and culture, people living and
                                        working in worlds of their choosing. It
                                        will be complex and sublime, peaceful
                                        and raucous, foreign and exciting (like
                                        a casino). But we aren’t there yet. We
                                        should be building it today, not
                                        building spaceships to Mars. First
                                        things first, we need to start with the
                                        entertainment centers which make real
                                        life so much fun. I’m a degen. The
                                        Metaverse needs a casino where players
                                        can gamble (or if poker is your game, I
                                        know it’s skill) their crypto, meet
                                        like-minded people and have a ‘whale’ of
                                        a time. This casino should be
                                        decentralized and owned by you and your
                                        fellow Fairy Planet NFT hodlers. The
                                        Fairy Planet Casino in Decentraland will
                                        be exactly that. And the utility of the
                                        Fairy Planet NFTs doesn’t stop there.
                                        Own one and you will be coming to Las
                                        Vegas for our Go-Banana Parties. There
                                        will be another party during the year in

                                        The Metaverse is the technological
                                        future. It is the future of Gaming, as
                                        well as the future of Gambling. It is
                                        the future of the Internet; the blurring
                                        of multiple realities; the fusing of the
                                        digital with the virtual and the
                                        physical world. Consequently it will be
                                        omnipresent. Not only that, the
                                        Metaverse is a mighty fine place to have
                                        a Fairy Planet Casino. So shuffle up and
                                        deal.

                                        There is a shift in the mindset of poker
                                        players and gamblers, a move from the
                                        traditional online casinos - where you
                                        can only use FIAT - to the
                                        blockchain-based Crypto Casinos where

                                        The first Bitcoin casino appeared as far
                                        back as 2013. Pioneers of the Crypto

                                        Roobet.com, have taken on the mantle,

                                        one of continued adoption and we expect
                                        the shift to be complete within the

                                        Gambling Ape Holders receive 70% of the
                                        Net Gaming Revenue of both Casinos. The
                                        70% profit share also applies to other

                                        a higher profit share than someone who

                                        Every casino has an edge; it’s what
                                        keeps the whole ecosystem alive. Every
                                        gambler knows this. The edge varies
                                        depending on the game. Roulette has a
                                        higher edge than blackjack for example.
                                        Baccarat has a lower edge than craps. In
                                        the Fairy Planet Casino the average
                                        house edge will be around 1.7%, this is
                                        in-line with the industry standard of

                                        need a gambling license, we will need

                                        obtain this license. We, of course, will

                                        If you have read the Bitcoin white paper
                                        then you will be familiar (and probably
                                        not understand) hashing. This is
                                        important because the Fairy Planet
                                        Casino will use Provably Fair
                                        Technology. This guarantees a fair
                                        outcome and allows players to verify,
                                        should they feel otherwise.

                                        “Hashing is the transformation of a
                                        longer string of data into a shorter
                                        string. In the context of provably fair
                                        gambling, when a seed number is hashed,
                                        it is encrypted. For all practical
                                        purposes, the cryptographic hashes used
                                        at Bitcoin gambling sites are considered
                                        unbreakable. This means you can be sure
                                        they haven’t been tampered with.”

                                        games, poker is the most communal
                                        experience and most liked by the Fairy

                                        The house edge is different from game to
                                        game. This is true in the brick and
                                        mortar casinos of Las Vegas and Monaco
                                        as well as online. The house edge also
                                        varies depending on your skill level.
                                        The house will have a smaller edge on
                                        Co-founder Noah due to his skill level
                                        at Blackjack, for example. Some averages
                                        to keep in mind: For Blackjack it’s
                                        around 0,85%, for Roulette 2,9% and for
                                        Slots 12,4%. Regarding the house edge,
                                        don’t forget that as a Fairy Planet NFT
                                        holder you will be collecting your share

                                        To advance those benefits, the

                                        facilitate a range of activities that
                                        initially will enrich the ecosystem of
                                        blockchain games as well as provide
                                        yield farming and content creation
                                        opportunities to their members.
                                        Fairyplanet DAO will focus on investing
                                        in current and future NFT (Non-Fungible
                                        Token) assets within games and emerging
                                        metaverses and lend the NFTs back to
                                        their guild members to optimize yield.
                                        The goal is to share the profits of the
                                        DAO with the guild members and the
                                        owners of the Fairyplanet Guild ($FRP )
                                        token and maximize the utility of all
                                        the NFT assets owned by Fairyplanet DAO.

                                        Fairyplanet DAO not only invests in NFT
                                        assets, but is also focused on growing
                                        and enriching a community for virtual
                                        gamers to produce content as well as
                                        enjoy blockchain games. One of the
                                        underlying motives for the Fairyplanet
                                        DAO is to facilitate environments in
                                        which more people can be exposed to
                                        blockchain technologies and enable them
                                        to capitalize on opportunities within
                                        different metaverses. This motive will
                                        be accomplished through accessibility
                                        and education provided by the
                                        Fairyplanet DAO. Delivery on this
                                        objective should provide reward to both
                                        the guild members and $FRP token holders
                                        by way of yield profits for their
                                        contribution to the Fairyplanet DAO.

                                        In essence, the Fairyplanet DAO is a
                                        facilitator of the metaverse community
                                        who believe that the metaverse has the
