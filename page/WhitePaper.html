                                        Welcome, dear friends and fellow degens!
                                        Is there a better time than today to be
                                        part of this incredible NFT space? Has
                                        there ever been a better time to be
                                        alive? For me there hasn’t been, what we
                                        are all achieving as a team is beyond my
                                        wildest dreams and I can’t wait for you
                                        to be part of the Fairy Planet community
                                        so we can share the experience. My
                                        co-founder and I are ravenous NFT
                                        collectors and big gamblers. But we are
                                        also entrepreneurs and see a gap in the
                                        market. We want to build an NFT
                                        collection that incorporates our passion
                                        for art and gambling, but also gives
                                        owners unmatched utility. Something we
                                        feel is missing in many of the NFT
                                        projects currently out there. The
                                        Metaverse will be a digital utopia where
                                        all is possible, everywhere, all the
                                        time, in high definition clarity.
                                        Infinite, vibrant, alive and buzzing
                                        with art and culture, people living and
                                        working in worlds of their choosing. It
                                        will be complex and sublime, peaceful
                                        and raucous, foreign and exciting (like
                                        a casino). But we aren’t there yet. We
                                        should be building it today, not
                                        building spaceships to Mars. First
                                        things first, we need to start with the
                                        entertainment centers which make real
                                        life so much fun. I’m a degen. The
                                        Metaverse needs a casino where players
                                        can gamble (or if poker is your game, I
                                        know it’s skill) their crypto, meet
                                        like-minded people and have a ‘whale’ of
                                        a time. This casino should be
                                        decentralized and owned by you and your
                                        fellow Fairy Planet NFT hodlers. The
                                        Fairy Planet Casino in Decentraland will
                                        be exactly that. And the utility of the
                                        Fairy Planet NFTs doesn’t stop there.
                                        Own one and you will be coming to Las
                                        Vegas for our Go-Banana Parties. There
                                        will be another party during the year in
                                        a city of the community’s choosing.
                                        Don’t live in the States? Afraid of
                                        flying? Live your life completely in the
                                        Metaverse? Then you can join the
                                        community for free-to-enter competitions
                                        with huge prize pools, poker
                                        tournaments, blackjack tournaments and
                                        sports betting tips and chats.

                                        Ethereum based Metaverse. It is owned by
                                        its users, powered by the MANA token and
                                        governed through a DAO. Since its
                                        inception in January 2020, it has become
                                        the virtual reality platform of choice
                                        for brands, creatives, NFT artists and

                                        LAND, when you own a piece of real

                                        build a digital environment in line with

                                        Atari recently announced they would buy

                                        up land and building their virtual HQs
                                        with MANA. It will be on one such parcel

                                        The Metaverse is the technological
                                        future. It is the future of Gaming, as
                                        well as the future of Gambling. It is
                                        the future of the Internet; the blurring
                                        of multiple realities; the fusing of the
                                        digital with the virtual and the
                                        physical world. Consequently it will be
                                        omnipresent. Not only that, the
                                        Metaverse is a mighty fine place to have
                                        a Fairy Planet Casino. So shuffle up and
                                        deal.

                                        However, not everyone is as open to the
                                        endless possibilities of a decentralized
                                        Metaverse as we are as Fairy Planet. Not
                                        yet. But we can hear the ground moving,
                                        a thousand degen apes looking for more!
                                        There is a shift in the mindset of poker
                                        players and gamblers, a move from the
                                        traditional online casinos - where you
                                        can only use FIAT - to the
                                        blockchain-based Crypto Casinos where
                                        tokens rule.

                                        The first Bitcoin casino appeared as far
                                        back as 2013. Pioneers of the Crypto
                                        Casino movement, Stake.com and
                                        Roobet.com, have taken on the mantle,
                                        enticing huge numbers of players and
                                        catching up with some of the largest,
                                        well-known online casinos. The trend is
                                        one of continued adoption and we expect
                                        the shift to be complete within the
                                        decade. Fairy Planet will play a big

                                        You’ll be able to play slots and cards.
                                        There will be a sportsbook and much more

                                        Gambling Ape Holders receive 70% of the
                                        Net Gaming Revenue of both Casinos. The

                                        a higher profit share than someone who

                                        The Fairy Planet Casino is going to be
                                        the best casino in the Metaverse with
                                        the best community on the planet. We
                                        already have thousands of fans, but we
                                        want to really change the NFT landscape,
                                        bring incredible utility to our art and
                                        supply the best games possible.
                                        Achieving this is why we have the 20%

                                        The 10% kept in the treasury will be
                                        stored as security for big wins by

                                        Every casino has an edge; it’s what
                                        keeps the whole ecosystem alive. Every
                                        gambler knows this. The edge varies
                                        depending on the game. Roulette has a
                                        higher edge than blackjack for example.
                                        Baccarat has a lower edge than craps. In
                                        the Fairy Planet Casino the average
                                        house edge will be around 1.7%, this is
                                        in-line with the industry standard of
                                        around 1.9%

                                        Yes, absolutely! And not only will we
                                        need a gambling license, we will need

                                        Casino is partnering with dot-Igaming to

                                        then you will be familiar (and probably
                                        not understand) hashing. This is
                                        important because the Fairy Planet
                                        Casino will use Provably Fair
                                        Technology. This guarantees a fair
                                        outcome and allows players to verify,
                                        should they feel otherwise.

                                        “Hashing is the transformation of a
                                        longer string of data into a shorter
                                        string. In the context of provably fair
                                        gambling, when a seed number is hashed,
                                        it is encrypted. For all practical
                                        purposes, the cryptographic hashes used
                                        at Bitcoin gambling sites are considered
                                        unbreakable. This means you can be sure
                                        they haven’t been tampered with.”

                                        and baccarat. The Fairy Planet NFT
                                        roadmap has weekly poker tournaments for
                                        all NFT holders, so we are especially
                                        excited about this. Of all the casino
                                        games, poker is the most communal
                                        experience and most liked by the Fairy
                                        Planet community. We realize this and
                                        will push for completion.

                                        The house edge is different from game to
                                        game. This is true in the brick and
                                        mortar casinos of Las Vegas and Monaco
                                        as well as online. The house edge also
                                        varies depending on your skill level.
                                        The house will have a smaller edge on
                                        Co-founder Noah due to his skill level
                                        at Blackjack, for example. Some averages
                                        to keep in mind: For Blackjack it’s
                                        around 0,85%, for Roulette 2,9% and for
                                        Slots 12,4%. Regarding the house edge,
                                        don’t forget that as a Fairy Planet NFT
                                        holder you will be collecting your share

                                        As we shift the focus to the future, our
                                        aspiration is to achieve an environment
                                        where ownership of NFT’s, tokens and
                                        cryptocurrency is widely adopted in a
                                        multitude of gaming and non-gaming
                                        mediums. The Fairyplanet DAO plans on
                                        partnering up with blockchain based game
                                        developers to develop engaging content
                                        for both casual and professional gamers.

                                        operations across multiple games, and to
                                        become a portal to the emergence of
                                        metaverses. Through the support that the
                                        Fairyplanet platform will provide the
                                        wider community by creating blockchain
                                        ecosystems for games, there will be many
                                        yield generating functions that will
                                        follow, benefiting Fairyplanet DAO
                                        members and $FRP token holders.
